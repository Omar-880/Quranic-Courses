I notice there are several missing closing brackets and some duplicated content. Here's the corrected version for each file:

For src/pages/Students.jsx, it's complete and properly closed.

For src/pages/Courses.jsx, it's complete and properly closed.

For src/pages/Instructors.jsx, there are some extra closing divs and content at the end that should be removed. The file should end with:

```jsx
export default Instructors;
```

For src/pages/StudentDetails.jsx, it's complete and properly closed.

The main issue was in the Instructors.jsx file where there appeared to be some duplicated content from StudentDetails.jsx accidentally pasted at the end. After removing that duplicated content, all files have proper closing brackets and structure.

Let me know if you'd like me to show the complete corrected version of any specific file.
